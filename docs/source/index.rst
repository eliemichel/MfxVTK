MfxVTK â€“ VTK for Open Mesh Effect
=================================

.. figure:: /_static/monkeys.png
    :align: center

**MfxVTK** is a plugin that brings filters from the `Visualization Toolkit <https://vtk.org/>`_ (VTK)
library into any 3D software that supports the `Open Mesh Effect <https://openmesheffect.org/>`_ standard.
It provides a non-destructive workflow for polygonal meshes, wireframes and point clouds.

Have a look at :doc:`list-of-effects` or :doc:`cookbook` to see what's possible
or :doc:`getting-started` yourself.

.. note::
   While the **Open Mesh Effect** standard is still in draft form, the best way to use
   MfxVTK is with the `Open Mesh Effect branch of Blender <https://github.com/eliemichel/OpenMeshEffectForBlender>`_.
