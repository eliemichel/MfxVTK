# MfxVTK

*An [Open Mesh Effect][OpenMeshEffect] plugin for [VTK][VTK] filters*

![Smoothing Suzanne the monkey with VTK filters](docs/source/_static/monkeys.png)

MfxVTK is a plugin that brings filters from the [Visualization Toolkit][VTK] (VTK) library
into any 3D software that supports the [Open Mesh Effect][OpenMeshEffect] standard.
It provides a non-destructive workflow for polygonal meshes, wireframes and point clouds.

To learn more, please have a look at [MfxVTK documentation][MfxVTKdocs].

ðŸš§ *Currently this is a proof-of-concept; it works, but more features and polish
should come in the future.*

### Features

- Surface/volume point sampling
- Creating tetrahedral wireframe from points
- Smooth and Decimate effects
- ...and more, see [list of all effects][MfxVTKeffects].

### How to use it

In the [OpenMeshEffectForBlender branch of Blender][OpenMeshEffectForBlender]:

- select your mesh
- open the **Modifier** tab and select **Open Mesh Effect** modifier
- in modifier properties, set path to MfxVTK plugin (`mfx_vtk_plugin.ofx` â€“ download
  [MfxVTK release] from GitHub or build it yourself)
- select desired effect from the drop-down menu

### How to build it yourself

You will need [Git], [CMake] and a C++ compiler toolchain (like Microsoft Visual Studio or GCC/Make).

First, build VTK (version >= 9.0), see [instructions on VTK wiki][BuildingVTK].

- Use `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` to make your MfxVTK binary not depend on VTK shared libraries.
- Turn off `VTK_GROUP_ENABLE_Rendering`, `VTK_GROUP_ENABLE_Web`, `VTK_GROUP_ENABLE_MPI`,
 `VTK_GROUP_ENABLE_QT` to make compilation faster.
- (Optional) Use `VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE` other than `Sequential` for better performance of
 some filters.

Then clone MfxVTK from GitHub (note that it has the OpenMeshEffect repository as a submodule):

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tkarabela/MfxVTK
``` 

Build MfxVTK using CMake:

```sh
cd MfxVTK
mkdir cmake-build
cd cmake-build
cmake .. -DVTK_DIR:PATH=/path/to/VTK-9.0.1-build  # change this accordingly
cmake --build . --config Debug
```

The plugin is now in your build directory: `src/mfx_vtk_plugin/libmfx_vtk_plugin.ofx`.

### How it works

It converts Open Mesh Effect mesh into `vtkPolyData`. General structure
of the plugin as well as handy C++ wrapper over the Open Mesh Effect interface
is borrowed from [MfxVCG].
