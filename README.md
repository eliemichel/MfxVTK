# MfxVTK

*An [Open Mesh Effect][OpenMeshEffect] plugin for [VTK][VTK] filters*

![Smoothing Suzanne the monkey with VTK filters](doc/monkeys.png)

With this plugin, you can process 3D mesh data using filters
from [Visualization Toolkit][VTK] (VTK) library in any software that supports
the [Open Mesh Effect][OpenMeshEffect] standard. For example, they can be used
as modifiers in the [OpenMeshEffectForBlender branch of Blender][OpenMeshEffectForBlender].

ðŸš§ *Currently this is a proof-of-concept; it works, but more features and polish
should come in the future.*

### Features

Effect | VTK filter
------------ | -------------
Laplacian smoothing | `vtkSmoothPolyDataFilter`
Windowed sinc smoothing | `vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter`

### How to use it

In the [OpenMeshEffectForBlender branch of Blender][OpenMeshEffectForBlender]:

- select your mesh
- open the **Modifier** tab and select **Open Mesh Effect** modifier
- in modifier properties, set path to MfxVTK file (`mfx_vtk_plugin.ofx`)
- select effect from the drop-down menu

### How to build it yourself

It's a CMake project with dependency on the VTK library (>=9.0). If you're
building VTK yourself, you can point CMake to your build directory, eg.
`-DVTK_DIR:PATH=/path/to/VTK-9.0.1-build`.

ðŸš§ *TODO better explanation*

### How it works

It converts Open Mesh Effect mesh into `vtkPolyData`. General structure
of the plugin as well as handy C++ wrapper over the Open Mesh Effect interface
is borrowed from [MfxVCG].
